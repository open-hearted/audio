The UK-based Al Khair Foundation said a team of charity workers has been killed in Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza.
The charity says at least 8 workers, including volunteers and journalists documenting their work, were killed when their vehicles were targeted Saturday.
Hamas called it a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement with Israel.
The Israeli military said it struck two terrorists operating a drone that posed a threat to Israeli troops and later targeted additional terrorists at the scene.
The charity denies the allegation, saying its team members were not terrorists.
The attack comes as US-designated terror group Hamas leaders hold ceasefire talks with mediators in Cairo.
Hamas says it will only release an American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four others if Israel fully implements the ceasefire agreement in Gaza.
A senior Hamas official says talks on the truce's next phase must start immediately and last no more than 50 days.
